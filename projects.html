            <p>It can be stressful to plan an itinerary for a trip, especially one to a new location.</p>

        <div class="box">
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>Create a website where people can share their suggestions for traveling in a specific area. 
                People can share their travel plans online, and other people can base their plans on those. 
                Make traveling much less difficult and stressful overall.

        <h3>Key Problems</h3>
        <p>
            One of the takeaways from our competitive analysis research, based on popular sources (internet forums such as 
            Reddit and Rick Steve's website), is that there is a demand for itinerary sharing (particularly in the form of 
            receiving tailored feedback on a tentative plan a particular user has); however, such feedback seems to be either 
            lacking (as there are not enough reddit users in a given itinerary feedback community, ex.  
            A place to discuss travel itineraries), or the community they post the itinerary does not specifically focus on itinerary advice (just travel in general, ex. Travel Hacks).
